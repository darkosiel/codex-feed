![CodeX X Feed](https://github.com/5M-CodeX/codex-feed/assets/112611821/ec0386c8-d75f-4cde-be86-a67dd6d503bf)

Welcome to CodeX X Feed, a versatile resource that enhances your roleplaying experience and Twitter-like interactions within your FiveM server. With CodeX X Feed, players can engage in immersive roleplaying actions and share their thoughts using a custom chat command. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with Discord, allowing you to mirror your in-game tweets in a Discord server for a broader audience.

This feature not only enhances the roleplaying experience by making messages more immersive but also makes it easier for players to identify and engage with in-game interactions. Each message includes chat tags and icons, adding a unique touch to every conversation.

With chat bubbles, your server's communication becomes more engaging and dynamic, contributing to a more immersive and enjoyable roleplaying environment.

## Features

- **Tweet in-Game and on Discord**: Use the `/x` command to compose and share tweets with your fellow players. This command allows you to craft custom messages, and they will be visible both in-game and on your linked Discord server.

- **Discord Webhook Integration**: CodeX X Feed includes Discord webhook integration, making it easy to relay your tweets to a Discord channel of your choice. Keep your community engaged and informed, whether they're in the game or on Discord.

- **Verification Marks**: Distinguish verified users with a prestigious verification mark displayed next to their username in tweets. Show your appreciation for trusted members of your community.

- **Customize Your Tweet Format**: Tailor the appearance of your tweets to your liking. CodeX X Feed provides customizable tweet formats, ensuring your tweets match your server's theme and style.

- **Logo Support**: Inject character and branding into your tweets by adding a logo. Set a custom logo URL in the configuration, and it will be displayed alongside your tweets.

- **News Updates**: Share news headlines and updates with the `/news` command. Keep your community informed about the latest news and events on your server.

- **Dot Messages**: Use the `/dot` command to send Dot messagesâ€”short, impactful messages within your community.

- **Interactive Roleplay Commands**:
    - `/do`: Roleplay description command.
    - `/me`: Roleplay action command.
    - `/dispatch`: Send dispatch messages.
    - `/schat`: Staff chat for administrators.
    - `/gme`: Global me command for all players.
